# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. One player uses X and the other O. The objective is to be the first to get three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. It's a simple yet strategic game that is easy to learn and quick to play.
